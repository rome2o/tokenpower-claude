# Browser Screenshot Compressor

Makes browser tasks cheaper. When Claude drives a browser, it takes a screenshot after almost every click. Each screenshot costs about width x height / 750 tokens, so a 20-step task can spend most of its tokens on pictures. This mod shrinks every screenshot before Claude reads it. Half of each side is about a quarter of the tokens.

It was called Image Offload. It does the same job under a name that says where the saving is.

## What it watches

- Browser pane screenshots (the built-in browser in the desktop app).
- Claude in Chrome screenshots.
- Any other tool result with a picture in it: Read on a picture file, or a connector that returns one.

## How it works

- A `tool.call` hook waits for the tool's result, finds each picture, and shrinks it with macOS `sips` (scale 0.5, never under 512 px on the long side). Small pictures pass as they are.
- Browser pane screenshots keep their coordinate frame. The mod rewrites the tool's own line to `Screenshot size: 800x500 0.5-scale view; coordinate frame: 1600x1000`, so clicks still land in the right place.
- Other pictures get a note that says how to map a point back to the original size.
- A zoom, or a screenshot where Claude set its own `scale`, is left as Claude asked. When Claude needs small text, it zooms or reads the page as text.
- Each shrink appends one line to `~/.claude/mods-logs/savings.jsonl` (with `mod: "browser-screenshot-compressor"`) and one to `~/.claude/mods-logs/browser-screenshot-compressor.log`, and shows a toast.

## The pane

The "Browser Screenshot Compressor" pane opens by itself when the mod shrinks a picture.

- Reopen it with every card from this chat: type `/efficient-browser pane` (or `/efficient-browser` with nothing after it), or press Open in `/mods`.
- If you close it, it stays closed until you ask for it again.
- `"browser-screenshot-compressor:hidden": true` in switches.json (the Shown/Hidden button in `/mods`) stops it opening by itself. The mod still shrinks pictures.

What it shows:

- Tiles on top: Pictures seen, Shrunk, Tokens saved, for this chat.
- One card for each picture it shrank: the tool, the original size, the new size, and the tokens before and after.
- One small card for each tool call with pictures it left alone, and why. For example "1 picture left alone: already small (Claude set scale 0.45)". The log says the reason for each picture.
- A picture Claude sized itself is always left alone: a zoom, or a screenshot with its own `scale`. In a `browser_batch` the scale is on each action, so the mod matches each picture to its screenshot or zoom action in order.
- The 3 newest shrunk pictures show a small copy (a 160 px JPEG). The terminal shows no pictures.
- "Details" opens a card: the full tool name and the note Claude got with the picture.
- When you reopen the pane, any shrink the ledger has and the pane lost comes back as a card.
- The mascot is a pixel Claude camera with a flash and a photo. It moves while a picture is shrunk, and for 2 seconds after.
- The `/mods` switch closes the pane, and the pane says "Turned off".

## Commands

- `/efficient-browser`: status and tokens saved in this chat. It opens the pane too.
- `/efficient-browser pane`: open the pane with every card from this chat.
- `/efficient-browser full`: the next screenshot comes through at full size, then shrinking starts again.
- `/efficient-browser describe`: a Haiku subagent writes each screenshot out in words, so Claude gets no picture. `/efficient-browser shrink` goes back.
- `/efficient-browser scale 0.5`, `/efficient-browser min 512`: change the shrink.

The `/mods` switchboard turns it off with `"browser-screenshot-compressor": false` in `~/.claude/mods/switches.json`.

## Limits

- Needs macOS (`sips`).
- Describe mode loses exact positions. To click, Claude uses `read_page` or `find`, or you type `/efficient-browser full` and it takes the screenshot again.
- Pasted pictures in the prompt cannot be shrunk. A mod sees that they exist, but only a managed-settings install can read their bytes, and no hook can change the attachment list. The mod logs that they went by.
- Do not load this mod and Image Offload at the same time. Both would shrink the same screenshot.
